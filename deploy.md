## Deployment
how to deploy
<br>
copy the files
<br>
install node
<br>
cd to the app
<br>
run npm install
<br>
build the app
<br>
start the app from production mode: build
<br>
use the ssh key to scp the site up to the crown users directory
<br>
write a script that does all the deployment steps
<br>
install node
<br>
npm install
<br> 
npm start

<br>


# Start Here

# Crown User
Deploy crownuser to a server

<br>

# Create a crown user with ssh keys

## Enable ssh access to multipass vms

You want to ssh into the VM, because you cannot or don't want to use the standard shell command multipass shell <name-of-vm>.

The naive approach fails with permission denied:

```
ssh 192.168.205.7
The authenticity of host '192.168.205.7 (192.168.205.7)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:lWKUbxxxx.
This key is not known by any other names
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '192.168.205.7' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
gernotstarke@192.168.205.7: Permission denied (publickey).

Permission denied, although there is a route to this virtual machine available...
```

<br>

## Create new ssh-key for your multipass VMs
---
Create a reusable launch configuration for multipass VMs with cloud-init
<br>
Launch new multipass VMs with this configuration
<br>
Find out IP-address of new multipass VM
<br>
ssh into the new VM with this IP-address

<br>

## Create ssh-key

---
On your host machine (the one with multipass installed), change to the directory from where you will be launching multipass vms. It can be your home directory, but any other will do.


`ssh-keygen -C crownapp -f multipass-ssh-key`

```
Your identification has been saved in multipass-ssh-key
Your public key has been saved in multipass-ssh-key.pub
```

<br>

vmuser can be any (dummy) username, it will later be used to log into the VM.
The parameter to -f is the filename for the generated key. You can choose a name of your liking, but there must not be an existing key with the same name in the same directory.
You will be asked to enter a passphrase, leave that empty! I know, it's not as secure as it should be, but multipass VMs are used for development and test only...

Empty passphrases are NOT suited for production environments.

<br>

## Create cloud-init configuration
---
Cloud-init is the standardized approach for cross-platform cloud and VM configuration of instance initialization.
Multipass can handle such configuration, we use it to pass the ssh key into the vm.

<br>

## In the directory where you generated the ssh-key, execute the following:

`touch cloud-init.yaml`

`nano cloud-init.yaml`


Put the following content into this file:
```
users:
  - default
  - name: vmuser
    sudo: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
    ssh_authorized_keys:
    - <content of YOUR public key> 
```

<br>

The content with you public key starts with the letters ssh-rsa and ends with the username you supplied in step 1. Both have to be included!

<br>

Remember, it's yaml: Sensitive to spaces and dashes.
In case you generated an ed25519 type of key, it starts with ssh-ed25519. If you don't know what I'm talking about, ignore this last line.

<br>

## Launch multipass VM with ssh configuration
You will use a slightly different launch command for your VM, by adding the cloud-init parameter:

`multipass shell <name-of-vm>`

`multipass launch -n crownapp --cloud-init cloud-init.yaml`

Launched: testvm  

testvm is the name of your new vm, you can choose any name or even leave it blank. In the latter case, multipass will create a random name for you.

cloud-init.yaml is the name of the configuration file we created in step 2.

<br>

## Find IP address of new VM

`multipass info crownapp`
```
Name:           crownapp
State:          Running
IPv4:           192.168.64.9
Release:        Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS
Image hash:     4d8d5b95082e (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)
Load:           0.77 0.25 0.09
Disk usage:     1.4G out of 4.7G
Memory usage:   176.8M out of 969.6M
Mounts:         --
```

testvm is the name of the VM you were using in step 3 (launch VM).
The output of the info command contains the IPv4 address of this VM, you need that in the next step.

<br>

## ssh into new VM

`ssh crownapp@192.168.64.9 -i multipass-ssh-key -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no`

`sudo apt update`

```

vmuser is the username for which you created the ssh key
Please replace the IP address by the one you found out in step 4.
And voil√° - you made it.
The command itself should be obvious... you pass the name of the ssh-key with the -i command (short for identity). 

<br>

In addition, you turn strict host checking off.

You might see additional messages, depending on your host machine ssh configuration - but you should be logged in your multipass VM by now.
